### __** This folder contains the training logs of experiments ran in the notebooks **__

> Since our experiments are performed on Google Colab for higher RAM space and better GPUs availability, most of our development codes are stored in notebooks. This folder contains the training results and model checkpoints for the corresponding notebooks.
> * For a complete list of correspondence between notebooks and training logs, refer to `results/experiments_tracking_details/older_exp_details.html`
