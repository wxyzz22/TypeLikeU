    "The goal of this project is to develop a deep-learning based model `TypeLikeU` for predicting users' keystroke dynamics. Since there is no prior work on this problem based on the literature on keystroke dynamics that the author can find, the emphasis of this project will be constructing new features, experimenting with the variables, and achieving a baseline understanding of what works and what does not. In particular, we sythesized some feature engineering methods from the Keystroke Dynamics Authentication (KDA) literature and proposed some new feature enginnering methods for encoding keystroke dynamics while preserving the sequential nature of keystrokes as well as the positional information from keyboard layouts. Finally, the results from this project can be served as a baseline for future work on this topic."

    "Keystroke dynamics refers to the detailed timing information of key pressese and releases associated to a typing event of an individual on a keyboard. Such information can be characteristic enough to be used as biometric data for identifying individuals: dating back to the late 19th century, telegram operators could be identified according to their unique tapping rhythem [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_dynamics#cite_note-7)]; then, starting from the early 2000s, with the rise of computer usage and global network access, keystroke dynamics has been studied in the context of cybersecurity as a potentially more efficient and reliable method for authenticating users [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_dynamics#cite_note-7)]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional authentication methods requires constructive information such as passwords and QR codes, which has no deterministic connections to individual users. In seeking for higher security level, authentication methods through biometric data such as fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scan are invented. However, the application of these biometric authentication systems is currently limited to specialized tasks and environments such as airports and policy agencies due to their requirements of specialized hardware. Keystroke dynamics based authentication, on the other hand, requires no special hardware and provides a non-intrusive means of authentication; moreover, depending on the implementation of such system, keystroke dynamics authentication can be a continuous process, as oppose to the traditional one-time authentication style [[2](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5133925?cookieSet=1)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Keystroke dynamics authentication (KDA) is intrinsically a __classification problem__: giving a sequence of character entries and corresponding keystroke dynamics, a model aims to match a user in the database or determine the data is entered by an imposter. There has been extensive work done within the scope of such classification problem to design and compare different models, provide scalable solutions, and incorporate unseen users. However, another naturally related problem to KDA in the context of cybersecurity has received much less attention: the replicability of individuals' keystroke dynamics -- knowing a certain amount of historical keystroke dynamics data of a user, can _an imposter_ generate similar keystroke patterns to fool the authentication system? More explicitly, this is the __regression problem__ related to keystroke dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of KDA, the regression problem can serve to test the security level of keystroke dynamic√è based authentication systems (classification model); or even as the generator player of a GAN network [[X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network)]. \n",
    "There has been experiments conducted which desmonstrate the vulnerability of keystroke dynamics based authentication scheme [[3](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.rice.edu/doi/10.1145/3372420), [4](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.rice.edu/doi/pdf/10.1145/2516960)]; though, the mimicry attacks are generally generated through human imposters (untrained or trained e.g. via intentional practice or via assisted softwares) [[5](https://flyer.sis.smu.edu.sg/ndss13-tey.pdf), [6](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8487341), [3](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.rice.edu/doi/pdf/10.1145/3372420)], or are launched through algorithmatic programs designed with traits studied and extracted through statistical analysis by experts [[4](https://dl-acm-org.ezproxy.rice.edu/doi/10.1145/2516960)]. These mimicry attacks against the existing keystroke dynamics based authentication scheme are not the most efficient and often require substantial amount of human intervention efforts; on the other hand, since these keystroke dynamics based authentication scheme are often machine learning or deep learning models, why not have another machine learning or deep learning model carry out the mimicry attacks? \n",

    "Feature engineering is a crucial step in considering keystroke dynamics for several reasons. __(1)additional features?__ Generally, the only data that can be collected about the user's typing behavior are the (javascript) keycodes and the corresponding timestamps associated to key presses and releases, from which only little information such as the latencies (i.e. timestamps differences) from pairs of consecutive keystroke events can be obtained. __(2)features on different scales?__ On one hand, the keycodes are in nature categorical with around 116 unique keycodes (QWERTY keyboard with keypad) and thus probably needed to be one-hot encoded, whereas the latencies (in milliseconds) generally take value in large range $\\approx[0, 10^5]$ of integers. __(3)discarding outliers?__ On the other hand, the latencies are very unstable with large standard deviation and extreme outliers; this is even more so with _transition latencies_ involving timestamps from different keys. __(4)insufficient data per user?__ Finally, there is an intrinstic paradox in the \"necessary\" training samples per user: while deep learning models need more keystroke data per user to learn and distinguish different users, it is not realistic to require a large amount of keystrokes data from a single user from application standpoint. So, our only hope is for the model to learn enough \"common\" typing patterns from data of a large pool of users, and be able to use little data to distinguish individual user's keystroke pattern and adapts to it."

Most commonly, the unit token in keystroke data are either single keystroke (uni-graph) or a pair of consecutive keystrokes (di-graph), and the corresponding timestamps are processed into latencies: differences between the keypress and release timestamps. For a pair of keystrokes, there are six latencies one can compute; however, three of the latencies together uniquely determines the rest [[Alsultan](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313742321_Keystroke_dynamics_authentication_A_survey_of_free-text), [15](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05570.pdf), [13](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404820301334)]. \n",

    "Traditionally, the keystroke data are considered as time series and are organized into sequential format where each time step corresponds to a unit token represented in its feature vector. For example, with respect to unit token being _uni-graph_, a common feature vector resembles the following:\n",

    "As briefly mentioned earlier, a sequential input vector has some intrinsic downsides: on one hand, the javascript keycodes need to be one-hot encoded, which makes the input vector very sparse; on the other hand, the non-zero entries of a feature vector include the latencies which takes value in integer range much larger than $[0,1]$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the popularity gained by convolutional neural networks in recent years, there are attempts using CNN models to tackle the keystroke dynamics problem. The most immediate adaptation for this purpose is to take the fixed time-window length sub-dataframe as \"images\" and pass them directly into a CNN model. Beyond that, there are many other methods proposed to encode the features into more \"image\"-like features. For example, in [[14](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07009.pdf)], the authors proposed a new feature engineering method, called the keystroke dynamics image (KDI), to encode keystrokes (in a fixed window) into \"an image\": each \"color channel\" of the image corresponds to a single feature, and the $(i,j)$-entry of each matrix encodes the feature value corresponding to the (ordered) pair of keystrokes with (encoded) keycodes $(i,j)$. \n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors compaired this KDI input format against the traiditional sequential input format (each row represents a keystroke) using two different models: a CNN model and a CNN-RNN model. Even though the KDI input format outperforms the tradictional sequential featurel based on their experiement results, there lacked the comparison of the sequential input format training on a purely RNN model, so it's unclear whether KDI is indeed a better feature encoding method, or it is only better then taking fixed time-window length sub-dataframe as \"images\". In [[Piugie](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03716818/document)], the authors proposed another \"image\"-like feature engineer method by converting the latencies feature vector ]into a matrix using _squarenorm()_ function in _Matlab_, which essentially computes the pair-wise distances of the latencies; the matrix is then transformed into a 3D-tensor using the _imagesc()_ function in _Matlab_. The authors then uses multiple state-of-art pretrained convnet models to process these feature images, among which GoogleNet seems to perform the best in terms of Equal Error Rate (EER).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These image-like feature engineering methods, however, has a common critical downside to the more traditional sequantial input formats: it forgets the instrinsic sequential ordering of the timestamps (beyond a length of 2 in di-graphs) within the fixed-window size by bagging them into a single matrix or separates them into different matrices. This missing piece of information might not be critical in the classification task, but is intuitively less likely to be unimportant in keystroke timestamps predicion (the regression task), as users tends to produce more mistakes later into a continuous typing session.

For example, in [[Singh](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5990168)] a keyboard grouping technique was introduced to classify keycodes based on their locations on the keyboard, which was divided into eight sections: two left and right halves and then each half divided into four lines representing the rows of the keyboard. In [[Alsultan2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6722548)], by considering key-pairs on keyboard within a certain finger distance, the authors incorporated keyboard layout into their proposed keystroke dynamics authentication system to calculate similarity between the timing features typed and the user's profile data using the Euclidean distance.

    "Keystroke dynamics datasets, especially those created for the purpose of training free-text keystroke system, generally contain many noises caused by extreme hold latencies or transition latencies involving more than two keys. Preprocessing the noises present in these keystroke dynamics datasets could be crucial, as otherwise the outliers might influence the ability for any model to learn. In [[Alsultan](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313742321_Keystroke_dynamics_authentication_A_survey_of_free-text)], the authors surveyed past choices made for removing noise from the keystroke data: some researchers chose to keep only the keystrokes for which the hold latencies and transition latencies are below a predefined standard deviation were added to the users pool [16, 17]; some other researchers, like in [18], choise to fix hard minimum and maximum to limit the range that timing latencies can take values in, where the choice of range of the latencies (i.e. the minimum and maximum).\n",

Thus, one needs to be careful when discarding outliers, as there might be \"True\" outliers that the model is supposed to learn. For example, consider the following box plot of the distributions of keystroke Press Latencies of six users:\n",

Similarly, PL $\\approx 2800$ seems to be an outlier data for User 35, but it is a relatively normal data for User 83. Moreover, some of these points outside of the 4 time Interquartile Range (IQR) can even be crucial information for distinguishing users: for example, User 83 and User 144 have relatively small number of points outside of $4*$IQR, whereas the other four users both have relatively large number of points outside of $4*$IQR. Then, consider User 102, which has three data points that are clearly outliers: this could be where the user was distracted and temporarily zoomed out of their continuous typing session. Extreme outliers of this type can negatively influence the model training process. Finally, a common pattern that we are seeing here is that for each of the user, there are generally no more than 5-10 extreme outlier data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these observation on individual user's keystroke latencies, we can conclude that dropping outliers on a global level is __not__ going to be very useful, as users sits on different keystroke latency ranges; outlier filters must be applied on user-level. To filter out outliers, we can either use quantile-ranges, setting standard deviations, or hard minima and maxima. However, based on our observation for outlier samples, it might be more effective to filter out absolute number of data points for each user: the smallest and largest 3-10 latencies."

Moreover, in our past experience working with RNN models, as well as in experiments conducted in [13], GRU layers generally outperform LSTM layers. Finally, the number of units used in TypeNet is pretty high; even though in theory we should have enough training examples for such high amount of units (see __Section 4.1 The Dataset__ for description of our dataset), due to actual training resource limitations as well as training time limit, we will only use a small portion of the entire dataset.

As simple as this task may sound when it is summarized into one-sentence above, the feature extraction phase actually consumed the bulk of my project time, and let me briefly communicates the difficulties here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.1. Time Latencies Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "The intuitive way to extract time latencies from the `PRESS_TIME` and `RELEASE_TIME` columns is to just loop through pairs of consecutive rows and perform the subtractions. However, one needs to be careful here: \n",
    "* __we have a large number of rows, to loop through the entire dataframe every time we need to perform time latencies extraction will take up substantial amount of time__\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to find a way to vectorize the process and take advantage of the pandas dataframe ability making efficient large dataframe operations. One solution is to make use of _shifts_: for example, suppose we named the training set dataframe `train_data`, then\n",
    "* to obtain the Hold Latency (`HL`): calculate `train_data['PRESS_TIME'] - train_data['RELEASE_TIME']`\n",
    "* to obtain the Press Latency (`PL`): constructe the shifted column `shifted_PRESS = train_data['PRESS_TIME][1:]` and pad the end of the column with any value, e.g. 0; callthen, calculate `shifted_PRESS - train_data['PRESS_TIME']`\n",
    "\n",
    "The other time latencies such as `IL`, `RL` are calculated in the similar fashion. However, there is a serious problem here: \n",
    "* __the entries of the shifted columns, e.g., `shifted_PRESS`, might not be what we expected__ \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, if a character 'A' is at the end of a sentence and a character 'B' is at the beginning of the immediate next sentence, then the `shifted_PRESS` of that row computes the keypress timestamp differences of 'A' and 'B', which can be a huge number since distinct sentences are not necessarily typed under one continuous setting and could even be entered by two different users at completely different times!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a snapshot of the statistics of validation datasets ($0.2%$ of 400 users) __before__ this mistake is fixed:\n",

Once I did that, I realized that this common patter of extremely large time latencies all came from sentence transitions.  \\\n",
    "This artifical outliers created because of this mistake is, of course, __THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING__ reason to why all our models are performly relatively poorly in prior trainings: using the mean absolute error as our loss, the best training loss __was around 600__, and the best validation loss __was around 2000__. For our most current training result, refer to __Section 5. Experiment Results and Discussion__.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.2. Keyboard Layout Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the key-pair distance metric suggested in [[Alsultan2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6722548)], for a pair of keycodes, we want to compute the relative finger distance between them. To do this, the simplest way I could think of is to firstly encode the QWERTY keyboard key positions with corresponding javascript keycodes as a Pandas dataframe, and then construct a Python dictionary where the keys are keycodes and the corresponding values are the $(i, j)$ position of the keycode in the Pandas dataframe. Since there are no keycode-keyboard encoding we can find online, I manually constructed the keycode-board encoding:\n",
    "<center> <img src=\"../img/keycode-keyboard.png\" alt=\"Trainset Statistics - Digraph Dataframe\" width=\"650\"/> </center>\n",
    "\n",
    "and using which, I define the Pyhton dictionary used to extract positions of the keycodes. Finally, the key-pair distance metric is the just the manhattan distance between the $(i,j)$ coordinates of a pair of keycodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.3. Image-like Input\n",
    "\n",
    "The KDI feature encoding method from [[14](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07009.pdf)] inspired us to consider the following new image-like input. Recall from the distcussion of this KDI feature in the previous __Section 3.1.2 Input Format: Sequential or Image-like__, we remarked that the KDI feature forgets about the natural sequential nature of the keycodes when being encoded into such a matrix. Thus, we try to modify this disadvantage by adding the `INDEX` (i.e. `I1` or `I2`) as a color channel in the matrix. Moreover, instead of hard coding the rows and columns of each matrix to be corresponding letters like in [[14](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07009.pdf)], we extract the most frequently appeared X many keycodes where X is the length of the matrices. Below is a visualization of color channels of a matrix:\n",

    "    <img src=\"../img/KDI-group.png\" alt=\"Keystroke Dynamics Image (Keycode Modified)\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "We comment a couple prominent features:\n",
    "1. the entries that \"lights up\" in all matrices are the same: this is from our construction, since the $(i, j)$ entry value will only be non-zero if the both of the keycodes in the keycode-pair appeared in top X (e.g. here is 25) most frequent keycode list. Moreover, $i$ is the frequency ranking of the first key in the keycode-pair, and $j$ is the frequency ranking of the second key.\n",
    "2. the matrices `I1` and `I2` looks the same: this is because color is a representation of the value in the entry, and since a keycode-pair has consecutive index, the values in `I1` and `I2` are also very similar. In training, we omit the `I2` feature and only use `I1`.\n",
    "3. the matrix corresponding to `IL` has much lighter background: this is because `IL` contains relatively large amount of negative latencies, which is known as the _rollover_ effect when one is typing -- the second key is pressed before the first key is released; this phenonmenon is even more prominent with fast typers [11].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.2.4. Incorporate and Streamline ALL the Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few variables we want to experiment with in this project. Below are a few of the important ones\n",
    "* sample size\n",
    "* unigraph V.S. digraph\n",
    "* use the Average User profile or original user\n",
    "* include keycode-keyboard features or not\n",
    "* whether to apply outlier filters; if yes, which filters to apply\n",

    "* for a pair of keycode in digraph, should one-hot encoded vectors be concatenated or added\n",
    "\n",
    "but of course there are the common hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, regularization, optimizer, loss, and etc., that also need to be experimented. And finally, we need to test out a couple different model structures. So, in order to develop the code to incorporate and streamline all these variables, the preprocessing phase took a substantial amount of effort and time of the entire project."

And the more prominent problem still remains: the losses were not improving at all. This makes us think of whether the __inputs to the CNN model were not enough__: an input does contain the keycode of the current prediction latency; however, this piece of information was baked into the $(i,j)$ index of the last timestep, and even if the model has the index information, it is not a direct piece of information.\n",

    "Now that our model performance has improved a lot and the losses seemed much more reasonable, it is time to understand the gap between the training loss and validation loss. In general scenarios, the gap between the training and validation loss is attributed to the model overfitting the taining dataset, and to resolve this, one would usually try to increase the regularization parameters or add in dropout layers. In our case however, the training loss is not low neither, suggesting that we also have an underfitting problem. So, before trying to tune the hyperparameters of the model, I want to firstly understand the elephant in the room:\n",
    "> The OUTLIERS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one still recalls the discussion in **Section 4.2.1. Time Latencies Extraction**, this is what we are getting into again. Around the time when I finished the work described above in Stage 2, I decided to dig into the outliers and answer the following questions:\n",
    "* how the outliers looks like?\n",
    "* why are they so extreme?\n",
    "* is it \"okay\" to staright up discard them?\n",
    "* what kind of filtering method should I use?\n",
    "\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `max` of all transition latencies 'IL', 'RL', 'PL' look very abnormal and so I decided to restrict to those large values to see what is going on with those users with huge transition latencies. Finding the user(s) in the data having 'PL' be the max of the 'PL' values, we obtain a single user:\n",
    "\n",

    "> The problematic row is precisely at a __sentence transition__!!\n",
    "\n",
    "This immediately rings a bell: when we are extracting the transition latencies, in order to save up time and make use of the efficient vector calulations for Pandas dataframe, we performed a __column-wise operation by shifted columns__. The column operation has no problem for the internal keycodes in a sentence, but for keycodes located at the end of a sentence, we will be taking the transition latencies between the user's last keystroke data of a sentence and the first keystroke data of the next sentence, where there is no guarantee that any two distinct sentences must be typed in a continuous environment (i.e. recall the typing data collection interface mentioned in **Section 4.1. The Raw Dataset**). And this column-wise operation is even more problematic when we firstly split the original dataset into train-dev-test sets and then perform feature extractions."

The first CNN model with this KDI input was not ideal; so we modified the CNN structure by adding the one-hot encoded keycode vector as an additional input. However, that didn't seem to help too much, neither. \n",

This decision brings out some quite interesting phenonmenon.\n",

    "On the other hand, the extreme gap between the **randomness** of `'HL'` and `'PL'` is worth exploring further: on one hand, one should acknowlegde that `'PL'` contains more variations than `'HL'`, because transition between two keys can be slowed down because of random factors such as the user is trying to read the screen, or blanking out for a second. On the other hand, there are still quite a bit of room to improve the loss: an idea is to try to include more features: recall that the dataset also comes with a _.txt_ file `metadata_participants.txt` which stores the meta information about the users. Perhaps this can help with the model performance."
