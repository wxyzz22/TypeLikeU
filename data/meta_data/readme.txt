The 136M KEYSTROKES Dataset
===================================
http://userinterfaces.aalto.fi/136Mkeystrokes

This is the 136M Keystrokes dataset. 
It contains keystroke data of over 168000 users typing 15 sentences each. The data was collected via an online typing test published at a free typing speed assessment webpage. 

More details about the study and its procedure can be found in the paper:

TEST_SECTION_ID			Unique ID of the presented sentence
SENTENCE				Sentence shown to the user
USER_INPUT				Sentence typed by the user after pressing Enter or Next button
KEYSTROKE_ID			Unique ID of the keypress 
PRESS_TIME				Timestamp of the key down event (in ms) 
RELEASE_TIME			Timestamp of the key release event (in ms) 
LETTER					The typed letter
KEYCODE					The javascript keycode of the pressed key


- metadata_participants.txt:
The field/column names are described as follows (see paper for details):
PARTICIPANT_ID			Unique ID of participant
AGE				
GENDER
HAS_TAKEN_TYPING_COURSE	Whether the participant has taken a typing course (1) or not (0)
COUNTRY			
KEYBOARD_LAYOUT			QWERTY, AZERTY or QWERTZ layout of keyboard used
NATIVE_LANGUAGE		
FINGERS					Choice between 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8 and 9-10 fingers used for typing
TIME_SPENT_TYPING		Number of hours spent typing everyday
KEYBOARD_TYPE			Full (desktop), laptop, small physical (e.g on phone) or touch keyboard
ERROR_RATE(%)			Uncorrected error rate
AVG_WPM_15				Words per minute averaged over the 15 typed sentences
